## Security Measures

StratoSort implements comprehensive security measures to protect your data and privacy:

### Data Protection
- **Local-first processing**: All AI analysis happens locally using Ollama - no data leaves your machine
- **File system isolation**: Limited access to specific user directories only (Documents, Pictures, Desktop, Videos, Music)
- **Restricted permissions**: Explicit deny rules for sensitive directories (.ssh, .gnupg, .config, hidden files)

### Application Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP rules prevent XSS and code injection attacks
- **Input validation**: All user inputs and file paths are validated and sanitized
- **Secure communication**: All Tauri IPC communications use type-safe interfaces
- **Memory safety**: Rust backend provides memory safety guarantees

### Development Security
- **Signing keys**: Application binaries are signed with secure keys (not stored in repository)
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Test coverage**: Comprehensive security test suite including:
  - XSS prevention testing
  - Input validation testing
  - File system access testing
  - Event system security testing
  - Rate limiting testing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Security Best Practices for Users

To keep your StratoSort installation secure:

1. **Keep updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Verify signatures**: Check that downloaded binaries are properly signed
3. **Review permissions**: Monitor which directories StratoSort can access
4. **Local processing**: Ensure AI processing stays local (check Ollama configuration)
5. **Regular backups**: Keep backups of your organized files

### Security Testing

Our security testing includes:

- **Static analysis**: Code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic testing**: Runtime security testing
- **Penetration testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Dependency audits**: Ongoing vulnerability monitoring
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing
